                <div className='about-text'>I am a sophomore studying at the Polish-Japanese University of Technology, with a strong passion for coding, particularly in Java and web development.
                In addition to my academic pursuits, I dedicate time to personal coding projects, exploring new technologies and enhancing my programming skills. I love the versatility of Java and enjoy building robust and scalable applications.
                When I'm not coding, you can find me at the gym, staying fit to keep my mind sharp. I also find solace in books, immersing myself in various subjects that broaden my knowledge and perspective.
                Basketball is not just a sport, but a metaphor for teamwork and problem-solving, which I apply to my coding journey.
                I am eager to contribute to the field of web development and create meaningful projects that make a positive impact. Coding provides me with endless possibilities and constant learning, and I am excited to be part of this dynamic industry.
